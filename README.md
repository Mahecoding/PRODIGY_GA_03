Markov Chain Text Generator: This project implements a text generation algorithm using Markov chains. It predicts the probability of a word based on the previous one(s) to generate coherent text. The dataset is loaded from Google Drive, and a Gradio interface enables interactive text generation with options for seed words and output length.
